        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Beulah Gateway Prayer Centre is a multidenominational fellowship with a heartfelt desire to share the Good News with the Beulah community and surrounding areas within Auki Township. The church and its ministries began as a family fellowship led by Elder Cornelius Ngui, his sons, and their families. In 2017, the Lord mandated the family to erect a small church building at Kunu, which has since grown into the thriving ministry it is today.</p>
        <p>Located in Kunu, close to the famous Osi Lake. We are affiliated with the Pacific Prayer Movement in Malaita, sharing a vision of forming a united Body of Christ eager to serve God in every possible way.</p>
